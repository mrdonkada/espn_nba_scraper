# espn_nba_scraper
Python scraper for espn.com that collects NBA game data from game logs and writes to csv. At the end of the code you can plug in your path, season, and team or teams you want to scrape for. It takes about 3 - 4 minutes to scrape for each season/team combinaiton. It returns about 8 - 9 thousand rows. 


This is what the first 6 row look like for the Boston Celtics 2014 season.
